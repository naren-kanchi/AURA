# AURA: Adaptive Unified Resilient Architecture

This repository accompanies the AURA research project and contains the complete implementation, experimental pipeline, and evaluation framework used to produce the reported results.

AURA is a federated, privacy-preserving, and Byzantine-robust AI system for critical infrastructure anomaly detection. 

This repository contains the complete implementation, benchmarks, and attack simulations for the AURA research publication. It provides a dual-layer detection pipeline using a Flow Autoencoder (Statistical Tripwire) and a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (Contextual Validator), secured by a novel Dual-Channel FLTrust (DC-FLTrust) aggregation mechanism and Differential Privacy (DP-SGD).

## Key Contributions

*   **Dual-Channel FLTrust**
*   **H=32 trajectory bottleneck**
*   **DP-SGD integration**
*   **Local STGNN reasoning**
*   **Automated privacy evaluation pipeline**

## Overview

Modern critical infrastructures require collaborative threat intelligence without exposing sensitive network traffic. Federated Learning (FL) enables this, but exposes the global model to Byzantine data poisoning and gradient leakage attacks. 

AURA addresses this through three core design choices:
1. **Dual-Channel FLTrust (DC-FLTrust)**: Upgrades the traditional FLTrust protocol by utilizing the Autoencoder's unoptimized `H=32` trajectory bottleneck to reliably segregate honest-but-anomalous nodes (under attack) from actively malicious Byzantine nodes attempting to poison the model.
2. **Organization-local STGNN reasoning**: Replaces traditional deep learning detection with GraphSAGE-inductive graph networks to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of lateral movement without federating the graph structure itself.
3. **Empirical Privacy Evaluation**: Evaluates defenses against Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG) and Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) natively through architectural bottlenecks, reinforced by Opacus DP-SGD ($\epsilon \le 1.0$).

## Repository Structure

The repository is modularized for research reproducibility:

*   **`Reproducibility.md`**: Strict chronological instructions for reproducing all paper artifacts.
*   **`aura/`**: Core system implementation. Contains the `models.py` (Flow Autoencoder, STGNN), federated learning logic (`fl_server.py`, `fl_client.py`), and the DC-FLTrust aggregation strategy (`dc_fltrust_aggregate()` in `fl_server.py`).
*   **`aura_attacks/`**: Forensic privacy evaluation modules. Contains `gradient_inversion_attack.py` (DLG) and `mia_attack.py` (Shadow-model based MIA).
*   **`scripts/`**: Orchestration and benchmarking scripts (`benchmark_byzantine.py`, `dp_epsilon_sweep.py`, `generate_publication_artifacts.py`, `train_explainer.py`).
*   **`dataset/`**: Expected directory for the target evaluation dataset (`NF-UNSW-NB15-v3.csv`).
*   **`saved_models/`**: Canonical pre-trained models (`aura_bundle.pth`) and dataset-derived heuristics (`attack_class_stats.json`).
*   **`logs/`**: Dynamic configuration thresholds (`calibration_results.json`) and runtime telemetry.
*   **`splits/`**: Deterministic dataset partitions (`canonical_split.npz`) ensuring strict isolation of train/test metrics.
*   **`results/`**: Output directory for generated CSVs, JSON reports, markdown tables, and `figures/`.

## Experimental Pipeline

The repository provides a strict, automated execution pipeline that mirrors the paper's methodology.

### 1. Training (State Preparation)
Establish the canonical pre-trained initialization ($G_0$) and calculate dataset-derived thresholds.
```bash
python train.py                    # fits the feature preprocessor, trains AE + STGNN, writes saved_models/manifest.json
python calibrate_thresholds.py     # thresholds from the held-out calibration split
python scripts/train_explainer.py  # explainer + attack_class_stats.json from training flows
python scripts/smoke_test.py       # wiring, leakage and manifest checks
```
The first run parses the CSV once into `cache/` (time-sorted flow table and feature matrices, ~2 GB). All scripts share one canonical, de-duplicated split (`aura/dataset.py`): test 20%, calibration 10%, server root 5%, training pool 65%. `TRAIN_DATA_FRACTION` in `config.py` subsamples the training pool only.

### 1b. Baselines (go/no-go)
```bash
python scripts/baselines.py        # → results/baselines.json / .md
```

### 2. Federated Benchmark (Robustness)
Evaluate DC-FLTrust utility against Byzantine poisoning.
```bash
python scripts/benchmark_byzantine.py
```

### 3. Privacy Evaluation (DP Sweep)
Execute the Differential Privacy $\sigma$ sweep, running DLG and MIA at each noise tier.
```bash
python scripts/dp_epsilon_sweep.py
```

### 4. Publication Artifacts
Regenerate all publication-ready plots and markdown tables from the JSON telemetry.
```bash
python scripts/generate_publication_artifacts.py
```

## Results and Features

Executing the pipeline populates the `results/` folder with complete forensic artifacts. Under the evaluated benchmark:

*   **Byzantine Robustness**: DC-FLTrust successfully distinguished Byzantine and honest client updates, achieving perfect detection under the evaluated benchmark configuration.
*   **Privacy-Utility Tradeoff**: Differential privacy reduced the privacy budget monotonically as $\sigma$ increased. Utility dropped insignificantly ($F1 \approx 0.48$) while achieving mathematically rigorous privacy bounds ($\epsilon < 1.0$ at $\sigma=1.0$).
*   **DLG Resistance**: Gradient inversion reconstruction quality remained poor under the evaluated attack configuration.
*   **MIA Resistance**: MIA achieved an AUC near random guessing under the evaluated settings, suggesting that the H=32 bottleneck contributes to reduced membership inference success under the evaluated threat model.
*   **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)**: Simulated interception correctly triggers SHA-256 Merkle root validation failures during global broadcasting.

## Limitations and Future Work

*   **Datasets**: Currently evaluated exclusively on `NF-UNSW-NB15-v3`. Adapting to fundamentally different topographies (e.g., CIC-IDS-2017) requires updating the `config.py` statistical feature map.
*   **Hardware**: Due to Pandas-based GraphSAGE window streaming, multi-core CPU utilization is heavy. The total benchmark pipeline requires ~1.5 hours to execute end-to-end on consumer hardware.
*   **Federation Constraints**: Simulates synchronous cross-silo FL. Future extensions may integrate asynchronous updating policies for straggler resilience.
